                                </div>
                                <div class="description">
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The sovereign of the air expands its majestic wings
                                        and
                                        leaps for an ascend to the sky! Hail the heraldic bird. </p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by the king of the sky, Arohan embodies its
                                        fierce flight to excellence. We partner with clients to curate avant-garde
                                        solutions
                                        that help them evolve exponentially. Like the eagle in ascent, Arohan's three
                                        wings portray the synergic vibrancy of the Troika &mdash; the individual, the
                                        team
                                        and
                                        the organization &mdash; collaborating to strive for brilliance. </p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Arohan's eagle tilts its head like a burning torch,
                                        signifying wisdom and learning. Its colours hide secrets for leaders&mdash; the
                                        sparkling gold depicts the richness in values, deep blue represents the strength
                                        and
                                        character to lead and ivory stands for dedication and the collective spirit. Our
                                        team, like our eagle, symbolises tenacity, fearlessness and the pursuit of
                                        greatness. </p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The ascent to excellence begins at Arohan! </p>
